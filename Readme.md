# 🛠️ Linux Kernel Driver Practice

This repository is dedicated to my practice and experiments related to creating drivers in Linux.

## 📚 Objective

The main purpose of this project is to learn and understand how drivers are developed for the Linux kernel. For now, it's all about basic testing, simple examples, and lots of experimentation as I progress through the learning process.

## 🔍 Current Status

📌 At this early stage:
- I'm learning about kernel architecture.
- Exploring kernel modules (.ko).
- Testing how to compile and load modules with insmod, rmmod, and modinfo.

## 🧪 Expected Content

In the future, this repository could include:
- Character device drivers (`chardev`)
- Testing with `/proc` and `/sys`
- Interrupt handling examples
- Communication between user space and kernel
- Good debugging and security practices

## 🚧 Note

> This project is under construction and is constantly evolving. Using the code here for productive purposes is not recommended, as its purpose is **purely educational**.

## 🐧 Requirements

- Linux system (preferably with kernel headers installed)
- Compilation tools (`make`, `gcc`)
- Superuser access (`sudo`)
